# Clean-environment lab validation matrix

A single, tracked table mapping **every** lab (`labs/day-{1,2,3}/NN-*.md`) to the
environment(s) it supports, the cluster-wide add-ons it needs, the tool/image versions it
pins, and its **honest current validation state**. It is the human-readable counterpart to
the future automated nightly lab smoke (**US-ENV-4**) and doubles as rehearsal tracking for
the manual clean-environment rehearsal (**US-BETA-6**). It exists *before* the automation
lands so there is a documented validation procedure and a live tracker of what still owes a
rehearsal.

Source of truth for this matrix: the labs themselves, [`infra/versions.env`](../infra/versions.env)
(the canonical pin file, ADR 0007), [`docs/syllabus.md`](./syllabus.md) (section map), and
[`docs/facilitator-guide.md`](./facilitator-guide.md) (add-on pre-install checklist). Nothing
here is invented — every version/URL is cited from the repo as it ships today.

## How to read this matrix

- **Environment** uses the labs' own badge grammar (see
  [`labs/README.md`](../labs/README.md#your-environment)): `namespace ✓ / kind ✓` (runs in
  both), `kind ✓ / namespace: read-only` (full path needs cluster-admin; a read-only
  namespace alternative ships), `kind-only` (no shared-cluster path), and
  `local — no cluster` (container labs, no Kubernetes).
- **Add-ons** are the cluster-wide prerequisites a lab installs (on kind) or that a
  facilitator pre-installs (on a shared cluster). "None" means the lab runs in a plain
  namespace with only the default StorageClass where noted.
- **Pinned versions / URLs** lists the reproducibility-critical pins the lab references.
  Where a lab pulls a **floating** reference (`…/latest/…`, a `stable` branch, or an
  unversioned `helm install`), that is recorded honestly as *unpinned* — it is a finding,
  not a blank.

### Validation-state legend

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `server-dry-run` | The lab's apply-able manifests are documented as **server-dry-run-clean** against a live cluster per the repo's status notes (roadmap M4/M5 progress + AR-05). **Not** re-verified in a clean rehearsal here, and **no** add-on install or behaviour/timing was executed. |
| `kind-smoke` | Reserved for the future automated nightly smoke (**US-ENV-4**): the lab ran end-to-end on a clean kind cluster. **No lab is in this state yet.** |
| `unrun` | No dry-run applies (local/read-only labs with no apply step, or the deferred stub), **or** the apply-able part exists but the cluster-wide add-on install / full behaviour has not been executed end-to-end in a clean environment. |

> **Honesty rule (US-BETA-3 / AR-05).** No lab is marked `validated`, and none is
> `kind-smoke`. Builds and dry-runs prove **syntax**, not behaviour. Per roadmap
> [M7 rehearsal debt](./facilitator-guide.md#rehearsal-debt-read-before-you-teach),
> the workshop has **not** had a full clean-environment rehearsal: the `kind` add-on
> installs, controller/CRD timings, and the verbatim `describe`/error strings in spoilers
> have **not** been run end-to-end. Timings and behaviour are **not** claimed here until
> rehearsed under US-BETA-6. Everything is therefore `server-dry-run` or `unrun`, which
> reconciles with M7.

## Canonical version pins (`infra/versions.env`)

These are the only versions the repo pins centrally (ADR 0007). Every cluster lab runs
against this Kubernetes release; the add-on versions further down are pinned **inline in the
labs**, not here.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `KIND_VERSION` | `v0.32.0` |
| `KIND_NODE_IMAGE` | `kindest/node:v1.36.1@sha256:3489c7674813ba5d8b1a9977baea8a6e553784dab7b84759d1014dbd78f7ebd5` (Kubernetes v1.36.1) |
| `KUBECTL_VERSION` | `v1.36.1` |
| `WORKSHOP_SMOKE_IMAGE` | `registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.66.0@sha256:e518c9d629672720031c601b9aaa83e218ecf5821aff5cc16ac972e109096540` |

It reserves the lab ID and is not schedulable as a hands-on lab yet.

## Add-on-heavy labs: canonical kind install + expected failure/diagnostic beat

The seven add-on-heavy labs named in US-BETA-3 (**S08, S09, S16, S18, S21, S23, S25**) each
list the canonical kind add-on install and the break→fix / diagnostic beat that seeds the
rehearsal. **S22 (cert-manager)** is included too — it is equally add-on-heavy and follows the
same shape.

| Lab | Canonical kind add-on install | Expected failure / diagnostic beat |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S08** Ingress | `kubectl apply -f` ingress-nginx `controller-v1.11.2` **kind** deploy manifest; kind cluster recreated with the `ingress-ready` node label. | An `Ingress` with **no controller** does nothing — routing only works once the controller Pod is `Running`; a wrong `Host`/path returns 404 from the controller (proving it, not the app, routes). |
| **S09** Gateway API | `kubectl apply -f` Gateway API `standard-install.yaml` **v1.2.1**, then NGINX Gateway Fabric deploy **v1.6.1** (provides the `nginx` GatewayClass). | Break `gatewayClassName` → read `status.conditions`: `Accepted` flips **False** (no controller owns that class). Add a header match to prove role-separated routing. |
| **S16** Autoscaling (HPA) | `kubectl apply -f` metrics-server `components.yaml` **+ kind `--kubelet-insecure-tls` patch** (kind's kubelet serves a self-signed cert). | Remove the Pod's `requests.cpu` → HPA `TARGETS` goes **`<unknown>`** and replicas freeze. Distinguish this from **metrics-server-down** (also `<unknown>`, different root cause). |
| **S18** NetworkPolicy | On kind, current **kindnet** enforces (kube-network-policies); **Step 2 is an enforcement self-test** with a **Calico v3.28.2 fallback** if the CNI doesn't enforce. | A `default-deny` ingress makes traffic **hang and time out** (`curl` exit **28**), *not* "connection refused" — and DNS/egress stay up (exit 28 ≠ exit 6), proving ingress-only scope. |
| **S21** GitOps (Argo CD) | `kubectl create namespace argocd` then `kubectl apply -n argocd --server-side -f` Argo CD `stable` `install.yaml`; apply the public `guestbook` `Application`. | Hand-scale a managed resource (drift) → Argo CD **self-heals** it back to Git. Set `selfHeal: false` → the app stays **OutOfSync**, proving detection ≠ correction. |
| **S22** Operator pattern | `kubectl apply -f` cert-manager `cert-manager.yaml` **v1.21.0** (CRDs + controller + webhook). | Declare a `Certificate` → controller reconciles it into a `Secret`; **delete that Secret** → the controller **puts it back** (the reconcile loop over a CRD it invented). |
| **S23** Prometheus Operator | `helm repo add prometheus-community …` then `helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack` into a `monitoring` namespace. | Break the `ServiceMonitor` with a **mismatched label selector** → the target never appears on Prometheus `/targets`; fix the selector → target goes **UP**; finish with one PromQL query. |
| **S25** Security & pod escape | **No cluster add-on.** Canonical path = a throwaway **kind** cluster the learner owns; every offensive step is gated by **`context-check.sh`** (exits non-zero unless the context is `kind-…`). | A privileged/hostPath Pod performs a single **benign read** (`cat /host/etc/os-release`) to prove host filesystem access — the "escape" — then the lab hardens the Pod so the same read fails. |

## Defect rows (pinned URL / version spot-check)

Best-effort spot-check of the pinned URLs/versions each lab references, done at authoring
time of this matrix (2026-07-13) with a fetch of each source. A broken or **archived/retired**
source is recorded here as a defect, **not** silently passed.

| ID | Lab | Reference | Finding | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **D1** | S08 Ingress | ingress-nginx `controller-v1.11.2` kind deploy manifest + the `kubernetes/ingress-nginx` repo | **Source repo archived (read-only) on 2026-03-24 and retiring** — best-effort maintenance ended, no further releases/bugfixes/security fixes; upstream advises new users adopt a Gateway API implementation instead. The pinned raw manifest URL still returns HTTP 200 (release artifacts persist), so the lab *runs*, but it depends on a **retired, unmaintained** source. | Track under **US-NGX / AR-02** (de-nginx): swap S08's controller to a maintained Ingress implementation (Contour) and add the retirement beat. Until then, flag at delivery. |
| **D2** | S16 HPA | metrics-server `.../releases/latest/download/components.yaml` | **Not pinned** — resolves to whatever the *latest* metrics-server release is at fetch time. URL is live and non-archived, but reproducibility is not guaranteed (a future release could change behaviour/flags). | Pin metrics-server to a specific release tag (and ideally add it to `infra/versions.env`) before rehearsal (US-BETA-6). |
| **D3** | S21 GitOps | Argo CD `.../argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml` | **Not pinned** — the `stable` branch floats. URL is live and non-archived, but the installed Argo CD version is whatever `stable` points at on the day. | Pin Argo CD to a release tag before rehearsal; record the tag in the matrix. |
| **D4** | S23 Prometheus | `kube-prometheus-stack` via `helm install` with no `--version` | **Chart version not pinned** — `helm install` takes the newest chart in the repo index. Repo URL is live and non-archived. | Pin the chart version (`--version`) before rehearsal so the operator/Prometheus versions are reproducible. |

**Verified live and non-archived** at spot-check (no defect): Gateway API `standard-install.yaml`
v1.2.1, NGINX Gateway Fabric v1.6.1, cert-manager v1.21.0, Calico v3.28.2, and the
`prometheus-community` Helm repo. The `nginx:1.27` / `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.27` /
`quay.io/brancz/prometheus-example-app:v0.6.0` / `quay.io/jetstack/*` images are the versions
the labs ship; registry availability was not exhaustively pulled here.

## A note on planned controller changes (US-NGX)

US-BETA-3 lists the required add-ons as *"Ingress-**Contour**, Gateway/**Envoy**, …"*. Those
names describe the **planned, post-de-nginx target** (roadmap M8 / **US-NGX**: Contour for
Ingress, Envoy Gateway, and a purpose-built `workshop-web` image replacing nginx). This matrix
records what the labs **actually install today** — ingress-nginx (S08) and NGINX Gateway
Fabric (S09) — because that is what the repo ships. When US-NGX lands, update the S08/S09 rows
and retire defect **D1**.

## What this matrix feeds

- **US-ENV-4** — the CI test infra whose **nightly chainsaw lab smoke** will move labs from
  `unrun` / `server-dry-run` to `kind-smoke` automatically (Days 1–2 first).
- **US-BETA-6** — the manual full clean-environment rehearsal that measures real timings and
  behaviour. This matrix is its checklist; filling the `kind-smoke`/rehearsed states is that
  human rehearsal pass, not a code lane.
