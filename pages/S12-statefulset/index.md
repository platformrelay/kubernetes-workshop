# StatefulSet

Give each replica a **stable identity** and its **own** storage — for workloads that
can't be treated as interchangeable.

**recommended** · suggested Day 2 · Workloads track

<!--
Section S12 — StatefulSet. Timing: ~30 min slides + 30 min lab. Follows S11 (Storage):
S11 made data durable but a Deployment shares ONE PVC across all replicas. S12 is the
answer when each replica needs its own identity AND its own volume.
Outcome: learners can say when a StatefulSet beats a Deployment; explain the three
guarantees (stable ordinal names, stable per-Pod DNS via a headless Service, per-Pod PVCs
from volumeClaimTemplates); read ordered create/terminate and partitioned rollout; and
prove identity + data survive a Pod delete.
Beats: problem (interchangeable Pods are wrong for identity/data) · mental model (three
guarantees) · magic-move (headless Service clusterIP:None → StatefulSet serviceName +
volumeClaimTemplates) · StatefulIdentity animation (ordered create → sentinel → delete
web-1 → same name/PVC reattach) · ordered lifecycle + podManagementPolicy + partition ·
PVC retention gotcha (currency) · recap → lab.
Animation: StatefulIdentity.vue (new, self-contained — the AC's "manifest-extends
animation" has no existing component; S11 set the precedent of a per-section animation).

kicker: The problem
---

A Deployment's Pods are **cattle** — some workloads are **pets**.

A Deployment gives you `web-6f8c9b7d5-abcde`, `web-6f8c9b7d5-xk2mp` — **random,
interchangeable** names, and (from the storage section) they all share **one** PVC. That's perfect for a
stateless web tier. But a database replica, a message broker, or a cache cluster needs the
opposite: a **stable name** it keeps across restarts, a **fixed address** its peers can
find, and its **own** disk that follows it. That's a **StatefulSet**.

<!--
Speaker: the cattle-vs-pets framing is the fastest way in. Deployment Pods are cattle —
you don't name them, any one is as good as another, and they share fate. The workloads
that break under that model are the identity-bearing ones: a Postgres primary vs replica,
a Kafka broker with a fixed broker.id, an etcd/ZooKeeper member that peers dial by name.
Three things they need that a Deployment can't give: (1) a stable name that survives
reschedule, (2) a stable DNS address for peer discovery, (3) their own persistent volume,
not a shared one. Hold the answer — the next slide names the three guarantees.

<!--
Speaker: these three are the whole section — everything downstream is a consequence.
(1) Ordinal names: the StatefulSet controller numbers Pods 0..N-1 and a deleted ordinal
comes back with the SAME name, not a new random one. (2) Stable DNS needs a HEADLESS
Service (clusterIP: None) — instead of load-balancing to one virtual IP, DNS returns a
per-Pod A record, so web-0 can resolve web-1 by name. This is how clustered software does
peer discovery. (3) volumeClaimTemplates is a PVC *stencil*: one claim minted per ordinal,
named <template>-<statefulset>-<ordinal>, and it is NOT deleted when the Pod is (or even
when the StatefulSet is, by default). Reuses the exact S11 PVC/StorageClass model — the
only new idea is "one per Pod, sticky to the ordinal." CKA/CKAD workloads domain.

<!--
Speaker: four fields carry the whole behaviour. serviceName is the one people forget — it
must reference a headless Service, and nothing validates that the name exists, so a typo
gives you running Pods with dead peer DNS (great teachable break, it's the lab). replicas
here behave differently from a Deployment: ordered, one at a time. volumeClaimTemplates is
the star — a stencil, not a volume; the controller stamps out data-web-0/1/2 and re-attaches
the right one to the right ordinal forever. The claim body is byte-for-identical to the S11
PVC, which is the point: nothing new about the storage, just one per Pod. Container spec
elided here for fit — the lab carries the full applyable manifest.

<!--
Speaker: THREE frames. (1) the headless Service — the ONLY difference from an S07 ClusterIP
Service is clusterIP: None, and that single line switches DNS from "one virtual IP" to "one
A record per Pod." (2) the StatefulSet body: serviceName ties it to that Service, replicas:3
will roll out ordered. Note the mount name `data` — it has no matching volumes: entry yet,
because... (3) volumeClaimTemplates supplies it: the template named `data` becomes the PVC
per ordinal (data-web-0…), and the container's volumeMount `data` resolves to that per-Pod
claim. That's the wiring: template name == volumeMount name. Compact teaching view (inlined
metadata); the lab ships the block-style applyable files. The lab applies exactly these.

- Write a sentinel into **`web-1`** — it lands on `data-web-1`, not the Pod.

Speaker: drive with clicks. (0) headless Service exists, no Pods. (1) web-0 created FIRST,
its PVC data-web-0 minted. (2) web-1 then web-2, strictly ordered, each with its own PVC —
contrast a Deployment spinning all replicas up at once with random names and one shared
claim. (3) write a sentinel into web-1's volume. (4) delete web-1 — its PVC is a separate
object and persists. (5) web-1 comes back with the SAME name, re-binds the SAME PVC, sentinel
intact. That last frame is the entire value proposition and is exactly what the lab proves.
A Deployment Pod, by contrast, would return as web-<newhash> with an empty (or shared) volume.

<!--
Speaker: four operational facts. (1) Ordering is the default contract — web-0 must be Ready
before web-1 starts; on scale-down the highest ordinal goes first. This is what lets
clustered software bootstrap deterministically (seed node first, etc.). (2) podManagementPolicy:
Parallel opts out when you don't need the sequencing (it can't be changed after creation).
(3) partition is the underrated feature: it's a native canary for stateful apps — pin the
partition high, update only the top ordinal, verify, then walk it down. (4) The cleanup
gotcha and the currency beat: historically PVCs from volumeClaimTemplates are NEVER
auto-deleted (safe default, manual cleanup — the lab's cleanup step). The modern answer is
persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy (whenDeleted/whenScaled: Retain|Delete), now GA — mention
it so nobody thinks manual-delete is the only option. Lab: cleanup deletes PVCs by label.

next: 'Resources & limits — right-size what you run (requests, limits, QoS)'
---

- **Deployment** Pods = interchangeable, random names, **shared** PVC — wrong for
  identity or per-instance data
- **StatefulSet** = **stable ordinal names** (`web-0…`) + **stable per-Pod DNS** (headless
  Service: `clusterIP: None` + `serviceName`) + **per-Pod PVCs** (`volumeClaimTemplates`)
- `volumeClaimTemplates` mints **one PVC per ordinal** (reuses the storage PVC), **sticky** across restarts
- Ordered create/delete (`OrderedReady`; `Parallel` opts out); `partition` = built-in **canary**
- Delete a Pod → **same name + same PVC** → data survives; PVCs are **not** auto-deleted
  (clean up, or set `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy`)

<!--
Speaker: the incident-time takeaway: "reach for a StatefulSet when a Pod's name, address, or
disk must be stable — otherwise a Deployment is simpler and cheaper." Two traps to name: the
serviceName must point at a real headless Service or peer DNS silently dies (the lab's break),
and leftover PVCs cost money because they outlive the StatefulSet. Hand to Lab 12: apply the
headless Service + StatefulSet, watch web-0/1/2 appear in order, confirm one PVC per ordinal,
write a sentinel to web-1, delete it, and prove same-name + same-data return; then break the
serviceName and watch peer DNS fail. Next section (S13) pivots from identity to right-sizing:
requests, limits, and QoS.

## Lab 12 — Stable identity

- Apply a **headless Service** (`clusterIP: None`) then a **3-replica StatefulSet** with
  `volumeClaimTemplates`; watch `web-0`, `web-1`, `web-2` appear **in order**
- Confirm **one PVC per ordinal** (`data-web-0/1/2`); `exec` into `web-1` and write a
  **sentinel**
- **Delete `web-1`** → it returns with the **same name**, re-binds the **same PVC**, sentinel
  intact
- **Break→fix:** point `serviceName` at a nonexistent Service → per-Pod DNS never resolves →
  diagnose from another Pod → fix and watch `web-1.web` resolve
- Answer the headline: *why did `web-1` reattach its data while a Deployment Pod would not?*
