# NetworkPolicy

Isolate workloads: default-deny, then explicit allows.

**recommended** · suggested Day 3 · Security track

<!--
Section S18 — NetworkPolicy. Day 3 (M5), the network complement to S17 (which hardened what a
Pod IS; here we control what a Pod may TALK to). Timing: ~25 min slides + 25 min lab. Outcome:
learners can take a flat pod network, apply a default-deny ingress policy to flip selected Pods
to deny-all, re-open a single targeted lane with an additive allow, and know the policy is a
no-op unless a policy-capable CNI enforces it.
Beats: problem (flat network — every Pod reaches every Pod → the S17 tie: a compromised Pod
roams) · mental model (NetworkPolicy = selector + allow rules; no policy = allow-all; the first
policy to select a Pod flips that direction to default-deny; policies are additive/allow-only) ·
code-annotated (the two-line default-deny) · magic-move (build allow-frontend-to-backend field by
field; final frame == the lab's file) · selectors (podSelector vs namespaceSelector; the AND/OR
gotcha; ingress vs egress) · CNI caveat (unenforced = silent no-op → the lab self-tests) ·
NetworkFence animation · recap → S25 · lab.
Animation: NetworkFence.vue (new, self-contained) — flat → default-deny fence → one gate open.
NOT a reuse of AdmissionGate.vue: that is admission-time (a Pod CREATE request denied before it
exists); this is runtime pod-to-pod TRAFFIC allowed/dropped by the CNI — a different layer, so a
distinct component (same call as S11/S12/S13/S16).

ACCURACY LOCKS (verified against the current NetworkPolicy docs):
- No policy selecting a Pod = allow-all for that Pod. The FIRST policy that selects it for a
  direction flips that direction to default-deny; only the UNION of matching allow rules passes.
- default-deny (ingress) = `podSelector: {}` + `policyTypes: [Ingress]`, no ingress rules. Empty
  podSelector selects EVERY Pod in the namespace.
- Ingress and egress are INDEPENDENT. A default-deny *ingress* policy does NOT touch egress — DNS
  still works (that is the lab's "why didn't DNS break?" question; exit 28 timeout, not exit 6).
- Policies are ADDITIVE/ALLOW-ONLY (unioned). There is no deny rule; a Pod is default-deny for a
  direction only because a policy selected it and nothing allowed the traffic.
- In a `from[]` list: selectors in ONE element are AND-ed; separate elements are OR-ed.
- Enforced by the CNI. `kubectl apply` accepts the object even if the CNI ignores it (silent
  no-op). Enforcers: Calico, Cilium, Antrea, and modern kindnet; some managed/basic CNIs don't →
  the lab SELF-TESTS enforcement (apply default-deny, confirm traffic breaks) before relying on it.

layout: statement
kicker: The problem
---

By default, **every Pod can reach every other Pod** — across namespaces, no firewall between them.

The Kubernetes pod network is **flat**: your `frontend`, the `backend`, the database, and a Pod
you've never heard of can all open a connection to each other. Nothing you've built so far changed
that. So the moment **one** Pod is compromised — the exact scenario Pod security was hardening against — it
can scan the whole cluster and talk to anything that will answer.

<!--
Speaker: the "why care" beat, and it deliberately continues S17. S17 shrank what a single Pod can
DO (non-root, no caps, seccomp). But even a perfectly hardened Pod sits on a flat L3 network where
it can reach every other Pod's IP directly — Services are just convenience names on top of that
flat reachability. Name the blast radius: a foothold in one web Pod can port-scan the namespace,
hit an unauthenticated internal API, reach the database. Edge firewalls do nothing about east-west
traffic between Pods. NetworkPolicy is the in-cluster firewall: "backend only accepts traffic from
frontend," enforced by the data plane. Default-deny then explicit-allow is the same shape as S17's
admission ladder — start closed, open only what you need. A named defence in S25.

<span class="kw-kicker">the one rule that trips everyone</span>

The **first** policy that selects a Pod for a direction flips that Pod to **default-deny** for
that direction — then only the **union** of matching allow rules gets through. So you deny by
*selecting*, and re-open with explicit allows. Policies are **additive**: more policies can only
*add* allowed traffic, never subtract. Ingress and egress are **independent** switches.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Speaker: three ideas, in order. (1) A NetworkPolicy is a selector + allow rules; it's allow-only,
there is deliberately no deny rule (deny is a different, newer API — AdminNetworkPolicy — out of
scope). Two independent directions: ingress = connections INTO the selected Pods, egress = OUT.
(2) The default with zero policies is allow-all — the flat network. (3) The counter-intuitive
part: you don't "turn on" deny. The moment ANY policy selects a Pod for ingress, that Pod's
ingress becomes default-deny, and only what policies explicitly allow passes. Multiple policies
selecting the same Pod are OR-ed (union of allows) — they can only widen, never narrow. That's why
the idiom is "default-deny policy first, then add allow policies": the default-deny is just a
policy that selects everything and allows nothing. Next: the two-line default-deny.

<div v-click="3" class="mt-2 text-sm kw-muted">
That's the whole thing: no <code>ingress:</code> key means "zero allowed sources." This one object

poke holes in.
</div>

<!--
Speaker: the smallest useful policy. podSelector: {} = all Pods (an empty selector is "match
everything", the opposite of what people expect). policyTypes names the directions this policy is
responsible for; we list only Ingress. Because there is no `ingress:` block, the allowed-source set
is empty → deny all inbound. Crucially we did NOT list Egress, so egress is untouched — outbound
and DNS still work (that's the lab's "why didn't DNS break?" question). Apply this and every Pod in
the namespace stops accepting connections; next we open exactly one path back.

<!--
Speaker: FOUR frames, building the allow policy that re-opens the one path we want. Frame 1:
podSelector picks the backend — "this policy is about who may talk to the backend." Frame 2:
policyTypes: Ingress — same as default-deny, we're governing inbound. Frame 3: the `from` list —
allow sources whose Pods carry app=frontend. Frame 4: narrow to port 8080 (a policy with a `ports`
list allows ONLY those ports). Two subtleties: (a) this policy and the default-deny COEXIST —
they're additive, so the effective rule is "backend accepts 8080 from frontend, nothing else"; you
don't delete the default-deny. (b) `from` selects the SOURCE Pods, the top `podSelector` selects
the DESTINATION Pods — beginners mix these up. Final frame is the exact file the lab applies.

<!--
Speaker: this is the slide that saves a debugging hour. podSelector matches peer POD labels;
namespaceSelector matches peer NAMESPACE labels. A bare podSelector is scoped to the policy's OWN
namespace — to allow from another namespace you need a namespaceSelector (namespaceSelector: {} =
all namespaces). The gotcha is pure YAML list structure: two selectors in ONE `from` element are
AND-ed ("pods matching X that also live in namespaces matching Y"); as TWO elements they're OR-ed.
One dash, opposite meaning. Point back to our lab policy: single podSelector, same namespace, one
source — the simplest case. Next: the catch that makes or breaks all of it.

<!--
Speaker: the operational landmine, and it's guardrail-critical (stay current). NetworkPolicy is an
API OBJECT enforced by the DATA PLANE — the CNI. The API server happily stores a policy on a
cluster whose CNI ignores it; you get zero feedback and zero enforcement. A green `kubectl apply`
proves nothing. Enforcing CNIs: Calico, Cilium, Antrea, Weave — and, on recent releases, kind's
own kindnet (via kube-network-policies). Older kind or a bare/managed CNI may not. The only safe
move is to TEST: apply a default-deny and confirm traffic breaks; if it doesn't, your CNI isn't
enforcing. That's exactly what the lab does up front, and why the shared-cluster path is read-only
when the room's CNI is a no-op. DELIVERY NOTE: re-verify the room's kind version enforces before
the session — the one fact most likely to have drifted.

distinction is a lab question). (2) allow-frontend-to-backend: the frontend lane turns green while

- The pod network is **flat by default** — every Pod can reach every Pod; NetworkPolicy is the
  in-cluster firewall
- A policy **selects Pods and allows** ingress/egress — there is no deny rule; the **first** policy
  to select a Pod flips it to **default-deny** for that direction
- **default-deny + explicit allow** is the idiom; policies are **additive** (union of allows, never
  subtract)
- **`policyTypes` scopes the direction** — deny ingress and egress/DNS still work; lock egress and
  you must re-allow DNS
- Enforced by the **CNI only** — `kubectl apply` succeeds even when nothing enforces; **test it**
- Pairs with **Pod security** (workload hardening) and is a named defence against a **pod escape**

<!--
Speaker: land the two-part model that carries into S25. S17 hardened what a Pod IS; S18 controls
what a Pod may TALK to — together they shrink both the foothold and the blast radius. Four things:
(1) flat by default; (2) you deny by SELECTING a Pod, then re-open with explicit allows, and
policies only ever add; (3) policyTypes decides which directions you govern — a default-deny
INGRESS leaves egress/DNS alone, usually what you want to start with; (4) none of it means anything
unless the CNI enforces, so verify. Hand to Lab 18: deploy the apps, prove they talk, drop a
default-deny and watch curl time out, then add one allow rule and watch exactly the frontend come
back — with the enforcement self-test first so nobody debugs a no-op CNI for twenty minutes.

## Lab 18 — Fence the traffic

- **Self-test:** confirm your CNI actually enforces (default-deny must break traffic)
- Deploy `frontend`, `other`, `scanner`, and `backend`; prove all three curl the backend (`200`)
- **Break:** apply `default-deny-ingress` → every curl **times out** (dropped, not refused)
- **Fix:** apply `allow-frontend-to-backend` → only `frontend` gets back in; the others stay blocked
- Observe: DNS still resolves under the ingress deny; relabel `frontend` and the allow stops matching
