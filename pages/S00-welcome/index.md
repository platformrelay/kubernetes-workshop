layout: statement
kicker: Why we're here
---

Three days to take you from **"what is a container"** to confidently
**authoring, running, and operating** core Kubernetes workloads.

Half the time is slides, half is your keyboard: every concept block ends with
a lab you run in **your own** environment.

<!--
Speaker: state the outcome out loud. The 50/50 contract is the promise of the
whole workshop — every idea is immediately practised. Point at the footer
progress bar: they'll see the red line grow all day.

- **Containers** — images, layers, runtimes <em>· then Lab 01</em>
- **Container security** — small, non-root, scanned images <em>· then Lab 02</em>
- **Mental model** — control plane, nodes, reconciliation <em>· then Lab 03</em>
- **kubectl** — get, describe, explain, apply <em>· then Lab 04</em>
- **Pod** 📦 — the smallest deployable unit <em>· then Lab 05</em>
- **Deployment** — desired state & rolling updates <em>· then Lab 06</em>
- **Service** — a stable address for moving Pods <em>· then Lab 07</em>
- **Ingress** — HTTP from outside the cluster <em>· then Lab 08</em>

<div class="mt-4 kw-muted text-sm" v-click>

The core spine is one **red line** — `Pod → Deployment → Service → Ingress → Gateway API` —
and every step **extends the same manifest** so you always see the through-line.

<!--
Speaker: the numbered cards are concept blocks; the "then Lab NN" tag is the
50/50 contract made visible. Gateway API (red line 5/5) lands Day 2.

- A slice of a **shared cluster** the facilitator runs.
- You own **one namespace** (e.g. `student-07`); no cluster-admin.
- Nothing to install beyond `kubectl` + a kubeconfig.
- A few labs that need cluster-wide add-ons run **read-only** here.

::right::

- A throwaway single-node cluster on **your machine**.
- You are **admin** — every lab, including add-on installs, works.
- Needs `kind` + a container engine (Docker or Podman).
- Panic reset is `kind delete cluster` → recreate in ~30 s.

<div class="mt-4 text-sm" v-click>

**Which am I on?** Run `kubectl config current-context`: a name like
`kind-workshop` means your laptop; anything else is the shared cluster. Every
lab states which environment it supports.

</div>

<!--
Speaker: labs are environment-honest — each one is badged namespace ✓ / kind ✓,
kind-only, or namespace: read-only. Nobody is left behind either way.

      No lab needs <strong>cluster-admin</strong> unless it's flagged

      namespace — that's RBAC doing its job.

The teaching rhythm repeats all day: **explain → run → observe → break it on
purpose → fix it → recap.** The breakage is the point — that's where the
learning is.

<!--
Speaker: emphasise "break it on purpose". Every lab has a deliberate
break→fix step so failures become familiar, not scary.

<span class="kw-kicker">How labs work</span>

# Every task carries a spoiler

Labs are standalone Markdown — explicit, copy-pasteable steps. **No "figure it
out".** Every task and every question is followed by a collapsed answer, so you
can never get permanently stuck.

<div class="mt-4" v-click>

> **Task:** set your default namespace, then confirm it took.

</div>

<div class="mt-3" v-click>

> **Question:** which command proves the change without dumping the whole kubeconfig?

</div>

<div class="mt-3" v-click>

Stuck? Open the spoiler:

```console
$ kubectl config view --minify | grep namespace:
    namespace: student-07
```

`--minify` collapses the config to the current context — one line, the answer.

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4 kw-muted text-sm">

In the real lab that answer lives inside a collapsed <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>
block. Try first; peek if you need to; keep moving.

</div>

<!--
Speaker: demo the spoiler pattern live — read the task, ask the room the
question, then "open the spoiler". This is exactly Lab 00's shape.

appendix while the room starts Lab 00. Client/server version skew of one minor

## Lab 00 — Setup & pre-flight check

- Confirm `kubectl version` reaches a **server**, not just a client
- Set your assigned **namespace** (or spin up a kind cluster) as the default
- Prove you can create workloads: `kubectl auth can-i create pods` → `yes`
- **Break it on purpose:** point at a bad context, read the error, switch back
- Land at the shared **clean baseline** — and learn the panic reset for later
