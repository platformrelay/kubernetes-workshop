# Jobs & CronJobs

Some work is meant to **finish** — and some of it on a **timetable**.

**recommended** · suggested Day 2 · Workloads track

<!--
Section S15 — Jobs & CronJobs. Timing: ~20 min slides + 20 min lab. Follows S14. Recommended
tier, Workloads track. Animation: NONE (per the outline) — the state changes here (a Job going
Complete, a CronJob firing) are read off `kubectl get`, not a component-worthy transition.
Outcome: learners can pick run-to-completion vs run-forever, drive a Job with completions/
parallelism/backoffLimit/activeDeadlineSeconds, wrap it in a CronJob (schedule/concurrencyPolicy/
history limits), and know when a Job beats a Deployment.
Beats: problem (a Deployment restarts forever — wrong for finite work) · mental model (Job =
run-to-completion, CronJob = scheduled Jobs) · code-annotated (Job knobs, restartPolicy caveat)
· magic-move (one-shot Job → wrap in a CronJob jobTemplate) · CronJob controls (concurrency,
history, timeZone) · decision beat (Job vs Deployment vs CronJob) · recap → lab.

layout: statement
kicker: The problem
---

A Deployment's whole job is to **never finish**. Some work needs the opposite.

Everything on the red line so far — Pod, Deployment, Service — assumes a process that should
stay up **forever**; if it exits, the Deployment restarts it. Point that at a **database
migration**, a **nightly report**, or a **backup** and you get a disaster: the task succeeds,
exits `0`, and Kubernetes **restarts it anyway** — running your migration in an endless loop.
Finite work needs a controller that understands **"done."**

<!--
Speaker: the "why should I care" beat. Deployment/ReplicaSet is built around a liveness
assumption — the desired state is "N Pods Running," so a container that exits (even
successfully) is a deviation the controller corrects by restarting it. That's exactly wrong for
batch work: a migration that finishes should STAY finished. Run it under a Deployment and it
loops forever; the exit-0 success is treated as a crash. The fix is a controller whose success
condition is "the Pod ran to completion" rather than "the Pod is up." That controller is the
Job. Hold that: run-to-completion is the entire mental model of this section.

<!--
Speaker: the whole section is one axis — does this workload have a natural end? A Job wraps a
Pod spec and adds a completion contract: it watches the Pod, and when the container exits 0 the
Job is Complete and nothing restarts. On failure it retries (bounded by backoffLimit). A CronJob
is a thin scheduler on top: it holds a jobTemplate and, on each schedule tick, stamps out a new
Job — so a CronJob "owns" Jobs the way a Deployment "owns" ReplicaSets. Click 3 is the sorting
hat learners should keep: run-forever controllers (Deployment/STS) treat exit as a fault; run-to-
completion controllers (Job/CronJob) treat exit 0 as the goal. Everything else in this section is
the knobs on those two.

<!--
Speaker: read it as "Pod template + four numbers." The restartPolicy note is the one that bites
people — copy a Deployment's Pod spec (default restartPolicy Always) into a Job and the API
server rejects it; Jobs only allow Never or OnFailure. Never vs OnFailure matters for the lab:
with Never each retry is a brand-new Pod (you'll see several Pods pile up); with OnFailure the
same Pod restarts in place (restart count climbs, Pod count doesn't). completions/parallelism
turn a single Job into a parallel work queue — completions is the finish line, parallelism the
width. backoffLimit bounds retries (default 6); activeDeadlineSeconds is the orthogonal wall-
clock cap — retries could each be short yet the Job hangs, so the deadline is a separate seatbelt.
Compact teaching view; the lab ships the full applyable files.

Speaker: three frames, one growing manifest. (1) The one-shot Job — apply it, it runs once,
COMPLETIONS goes 0/1 → 1/1, done. (2) Wrap it: a CronJob's jobTemplate.spec IS a Job spec, so
the whole step-1 body drops in ONE LEVEL DEEPER (spec.jobTemplate.spec.template — call the
nesting out, it's the #1 copy-paste bug). Same Pod, now on a 5-field cron schedule. (3) The
controls that separate a toy from a production schedule: timeZone (GA — without it cron ticks in
UTC and your "2am" job runs at the wrong hour); concurrencyPolicy Forbid (if last night's run is
still going, don't start a second — the alternative Allow overlaps, Replace kills the old one);
startingDeadlineSeconds (if the controller was down and missed the window, don't stampede-backfill
every missed run); and the two history limits (how many finished Jobs to keep for debugging —
defaults 3 successful / 1 failed). Note this magic-move is the compact teaching view; the lab's
files are block-style and applyable.

A CronJob is only a **scheduler** — each tick it just creates a Job and hands off. All the
run-to-completion behaviour (retries, `completions`, `activeDeadlineSeconds`) lives in the
`jobTemplate`, exactly as if you'd applied that Job by hand.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Speaker: these are the fields that separate a demo CronJob from one you'd trust in production.
concurrencyPolicy is the big one: the default Allow lets runs overlap, which is fine for a fast
idempotent job and catastrophic for a slow backup that now has two copies writing at once —
that's the lab's Forbid question. history limits are housekeeping: the controller keeps the last
N finished Jobs so you can read logs, and GCs the rest (with their Pods) — set them too high and
a per-minute CronJob litters the namespace with hundreds of Completed Pods. timeZone (GA) fixes
the classic "my 2am job ran at 3am" — without it the schedule is evaluated in the controller's
timezone, historically UTC. startingDeadlineSeconds bounds recovery: if the controller was down
across a tick, this caps how stale a run can be and still fire, preventing a backfill stampede.
Click 4 is the framing to leave them with: CronJob schedules, Job executes — don't look for
retry logic on the CronJob, it's all in the jobTemplate.

**Use a Deployment when the process should stay up.**

- A server, API, or worker that should always be `Running`.
- Exit is a **fault** → the ReplicaSet restarts it to hold `replicas`.
- Scales for **availability & throughput**, not for "finishing."

<v-clicks>

- ❌ Wrong for a migration: succeeds, exits 0, gets **restarted forever**.

</v-clicks>

::right::

**Use a Job when the work has a natural end** — a **CronJob** if it also **repeats**.

- A migration, import, backup, report, or one-off script.
- Exit 0 is **success** → nothing restarts; `COMPLETIONS 1/1`.
- `Job` for run-once-now; `CronJob` for run-on-a-schedule.

<v-clicks>

- ✅ Retries on failure (`backoffLimit`), parallelises (`completions`/`parallelism`), and
  auto-expires finished objects (`ttlSecondsAfterFinished`).

</v-clicks>

<!--
Speaker: the quick chooser. The single question is "does this work have a natural end?" If no —
it should always be up — Deployment (or StatefulSet for identity). If yes — Job; and if that
finite work also recurs on a clock — CronJob. The trap is running batch work under a Deployment
because that's the controller people reach for first: it "works" until you notice your migration
has run 4,000 times. The reverse mistake is rarer but real: a long-lived server under a Job that
keeps "completing" and getting torn down. Name-drop ttlSecondsAfterFinished as the current
auto-cleanup knob — set it on a Job and the object (and its Pods) self-delete N seconds after
finishing, so you don't need a CronJob's history limits or a manual sweep. Hand to the lab:
they'll run a Job, schedule a CronJob, and force a failure into BackoffLimitExceeded.

- **Job** = run-to-completion: exit 0 is success, nothing restarts; **CronJob** = a Job factory on a `schedule`
- Job Pods use `restartPolicy: Never` (retry = new Pod) or `OnFailure` (retry = same Pod) — **never `Always`**
- Job knobs: `completions`/`parallelism` (work queue), `backoffLimit` (bounded retries → `BackoffLimitExceeded`), `activeDeadlineSeconds` (wall-clock cap)
- CronJob knobs: `schedule` + `timeZone`, `concurrencyPolicy` (Allow/Forbid/Replace), `{successful,failed}JobsHistoryLimit`, `startingDeadlineSeconds`
- Choose by **lifetime**: stays up → Deployment · finishes → Job · finishes on a clock → CronJob

<!--
Speaker: land the through-line. One axis decides everything: does the work end? The Job adds a
completion contract to a Pod spec (and the restartPolicy caveat — Never for "new Pod per retry,"
OnFailure for "restart in place," Always is illegal). The CronJob adds a clock and the overlap/
missed-tick controls, but delegates all execution to its jobTemplate. The memorable failure modes:
a batch task under a Deployment loops forever; an Allow-concurrency slow CronJob overlaps itself;
a CronJob with no timeZone fires an hour off. Hand to Lab 15: run a Job to COMPLETIONS 1/1 and
read its logs, put it on a per-minute CronJob and watch Jobs spawn and history trim, then force a
non-zero exit and watch retries climb to BackoffLimitExceeded. Next section: HPA — scaling the
run-forever workloads we set aside here.

## Lab 15 — Batch & schedule

- Run a **Job** to completion → `COMPLETIONS 1/1`, read `kubectl logs job/<name>`
- Put the same work on a **CronJob** (per-minute) → watch Jobs spawn and old ones trim
- **Break→fix:** a Job whose command exits non-zero → retries climb to
  **`BackoffLimitExceeded`** → fix the command and confirm completion
- Answer the headline: *why did the failing Job stop after a handful of Pods — and why does
  `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` matter for a slow CronJob?*
