# Prometheus Operator

See an operator manage a real system; learn observability basics.

**recommended** · suggested Day 3 · Operators track

<!--
Section S23 — Prometheus Operator. Recommended, Day 3, Operators track. The operator pattern
from S22 made CONCRETE: S22 taught operator = CRD + controller running the reconcile loop; here
a real, ubiquitous operator (the Prometheus Operator, shipped in kube-prometheus-stack) watches
ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor CRs and GENERATES Prometheus scrape config — the exact S22 pattern in
the wild. Timing: ~30 min slides + 25 min lab. Outcome: learners can explain why dynamic Pods
break hand-written scrape config, name the four key CRDs (Prometheus, ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor,
Alertmanager), state that a ServiceMonitor selects a Service by label and the operator turns it
into scrape config, name the four golden signals and metrics-vs-logs-vs-traces, name
kube-state-metrics + node-exporter as the standard sources, read a ServiceMonitor + one PromQL
rate() query, and in the lab install kube-prometheus-stack, expose a /metrics app, wire a
ServiceMonitor (break it with a mismatched selector, diagnose on /targets, fix it), and run a
PromQL query.
Beats: problem (dozens of dynamic Pods — hand-editing scrape config doesn't scale) · mental model
(operator watches ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor → GENERATES scrape config = S22 made concrete, call
back explicitly) · the four CRDs (Prometheus/ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor/Alertmanager) · the four
golden signals + metrics vs logs vs traces · the two standard sources (kube-state-metrics +
node-exporter) · code-annotated (a ServiceMonitor selecting a Service by label + named port) ·
magic-move (ServiceMonitor selects Service → target appears in Prometheus → one PromQL query
returns data) · a taste of PromQL (rate() over a counter) · recap → lab.
Animation: NONE (guardrail: S23 is "made concrete" — magic-move + comparison + cards). Do NOT
author a Vue component. ReconcileLoop reuse is optional and not used here; the teaching device is
the ServiceMonitor→scrape-config generation, shown via the code-annotated + magic-move slides.

ACCURACY LOCKS (web-verified 2026-07-10):
- Sample app: quay.io/brancz/prometheus-example-app — tags v0.6.0 (latest, MULTI-ARCH, works on
  Apple-Silicon kind) and v0.5.0 (amd64-only) both exist. Serves /metrics on port 8080; exposes
  the counter `http_requests_total` (plus http_request_duration_seconds histogram, version gauge)
  and endpoints / (200) and /err (404). The rate() demo is on http_requests_total.
- CRD API group: monitoring.coreos.com. ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor/Prometheus/Alertmanager are
  apiVersion monitoring.coreos.com/v1; CRDs listed as servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com etc.
- Helm chart: prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack (repo
  https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts). Bundles the Prometheus Operator + a
  Prometheus + Alertmanager + Grafana + kube-state-metrics + node-exporter.
- TWO selector layers (do NOT conflate): (1) Prometheus→ServiceMonitor DISCOVERY — the chart's
  Prometheus only picks up ServiceMonitors carrying `release: monitoring` by default
  (serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues=true → selector = release label). (2) ServiceMonitor→
  Service TARGET selection — spec.selector.matchLabels picks the Service. The lab's deliberate
  BREAK is on layer (2). A THIRD, separate field: spec.endpoints[].port is a NAME (string) that
  must match the Service's named port — that's the lab's port-name QUESTION, not the break.
CKx tie-in: CKA/CKAD observability (metrics, monitoring) — a one-liner on the recap.

layout: statement
kicker: The problem
---

You have **forty Pods** across a dozen Deployments, and they come and go every deploy. How does a monitoring system know **what to scrape**?

Classic Prometheus reads a **static scrape config**: a hand-written list of hosts and ports to poll for `/metrics`. That was fine for three servers with fixed IPs. But Kubernetes Pods are **cattle** — they're created, rescheduled, and destroyed constantly, and every one gets a fresh IP. Hand-editing `prometheus.yml` every time a Deployment scales or rolls is **impossible**, and it's the exact opposite of everything you've learned: you declare *intent* with labels and let a controller do the bookkeeping. So what if **monitoring itself** worked that way?

<!--
Speaker: the "why care" beat. Prometheus's original model is pull-based over a STATIC scrape
config — a file listing targets (host:port) to poll for /metrics every N seconds. In a fixed
fleet that's fine. In Kubernetes it's untenable: Pods are ephemeral and get new IPs on every
reschedule, Deployments scale up and down, rollouts churn ReplicaSets. You cannot hand-maintain a
target list against that. The whole workshop has taught label-driven, declarative intent —
Services select Pods by label, not IP; NetworkPolicy allows by label. Monitoring should be no
different: declare "scrape whatever backs THIS Service" and let something keep the scrape config in
sync as Pods churn. That "something" is an operator — and it's the S22 pattern, shipped for real.
Next: the mental model, called back to S22 explicitly.

Recall the equation: **operator = CRD + custom controller running observe → diff → act.** Here the
**CRDs** are `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor` (your intent) and the **controller** is the Prometheus
Operator. Its **"act"** step is: *turn the CRs into a live Prometheus scrape config.* You met the

production everywhere.**

</div>

<!--
Speaker: THE load-bearing slide, and the explicit S22 callback the story requires. Say it: S22 =
operator is a CRD (extends the API) + a controller (runs observe→diff→act). Now name the concrete
instance. The CRD you'll use is ServiceMonitor: a small YAML that expresses monitoring INTENT —
"scrape the endpoints of any Service matching these labels, on this named port, at this path." The
controller is the Prometheus Operator. Its reconcile loop watches ServiceMonitors (and PodMonitors,
Prometheus, Alertmanager objects), figures out the current set of Pod endpoints behind each
selected Service, and GENERATES/updates the Prometheus scrape configuration — the thing you used to
hand-edit. As Pods churn, the operator keeps that config current. That's the "act" step: CRs in,
scrape config out. Nobody edits prometheus.yml. The lab makes you feel it: apply a ServiceMonitor,
watch a target appear in Prometheus. Next: name the four CRDs this operator gives you.

Speaker: the CRD roll-call — these are the new kinds the operator registers (all group
monitoring.coreos.com, version v1). Prometheus: a declarative Prometheus SERVER — you don't run a
Deployment yourself, you declare a Prometheus object (replicas, retention, storage, and a
selector for which ServiceMonitors it adopts) and the operator materialises a StatefulSet.
ServiceMonitor: the star of the lab — target discovery THROUGH a Service: select the Service by
label, name its metrics port, and the operator scrapes the Service's Endpoints (i.e. the current
Pods). PodMonitor: same but selects Pods directly (for things not behind a Service). Alertmanager:
a declarative Alertmanager for alert routing/dedup/silencing, fed by PrometheusRule objects
(the alert expressions). There are more (Probe, ThanosRuler, PrometheusRule) but these four are the
backbone. The verification one-liner — kubectl get crd | grep monitoring.coreos.com — is the first
thing the lab checks. Next: what should you even measure? The golden signals.

You need all three; Prometheus owns the **metrics** pillar.

<!--
Speaker: the "what do I even watch" beat. The four golden signals (from Google SRE) are the
starting checklist for any service: LATENCY (how long — and always look at the tail, p95/p99, an
average hides the pain); TRAFFIC (how much demand — req/s, the denominator for rates); ERRORS (rate
of failures — 5xx, timeouts, bad responses); SATURATION (how full — CPU/mem/queue, the leading
indicator that the other three are about to degrade). If you instrument only these four you already
have most of the value. Then the three-pillars framing so they don't think metrics are everything:
METRICS = cheap numeric time-series, great for dashboards + alerting (Prometheus); LOGS = discrete
text events, for "what exactly happened"; TRACES = one request followed across many services, for
"where did the latency go." Complementary, not competing. Prometheus is the metrics pillar; logs and
traces are separate systems. Next: where the cluster-wide metrics come from.

<!--
Speaker: the two sources every k8s Prometheus setup includes, and the distinction people blur.
kube-state-metrics (KSM): a Deployment that WATCHES the API server and turns the state of Kubernetes
OBJECTS into metrics — kube_deployment_status_replicas, kube_pod_status_phase, kube_job_* etc. It is
NOT about node CPU; it's "what does the control plane think exists and in what state." node-exporter:
a DaemonSet (one Pod per node) exposing the HOST's own metrics — CPU, memory, disk, filesystem,
network — i.e. the machine-level saturation signal. Rule of thumb: KSM = cluster/object state,
node-exporter = machine/OS state; you need both. The payoff: kube-prometheus-stack ships BOTH, each
with its own ServiceMonitor already applied, so a fresh install is already scraping cluster + node
health with zero config. Your job in the lab is to add ONE more ServiceMonitor for your own app —
which is exactly the day-to-day task. Next: what that ServiceMonitor looks like, field by field.

Speaker: the anatomy that the whole lab hangs on — and the three fields are THREE DIFFERENT THINGS,
say so explicitly. (1) metadata.labels.release: monitoring — this is the DISCOVERY layer: the
kube-prometheus-stack Prometheus is configured (serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues=true) to
only pick up ServiceMonitors carrying the release label. Omit it and Prometheus never even looks at
your monitor — it's inert, like a CRD with no controller watching. (2) spec.selector.matchLabels —
the TARGET-SELECTION layer: this selects the SERVICE (by the Service's labels), and the operator
scrapes that Service's Endpoints (the current Pods). (3) spec.endpoints[].port: web — a NAMED port,
a STRING, that must match a named port on the Service. Not a number. This is why the Service must
give its port a name. The lab deliberately breaks layer (2) — a selector that matches no Service —
and asks the port-name question separately. Don't fuse them. Next: watch it come alive in three
frames.

<!--
Speaker: the payoff arc, three frames. Frame 1: the Service — the ONLY special thing is that its
metrics port has a NAME (name: web). That name is the contract the ServiceMonitor references. Frame
2: the ServiceMonitor — pure intent: release label so this Prometheus adopts it, selector picks the
Service by app=sample-app, endpoints.port: web references the named port, path /metrics. You apply
these two objects and touch nothing else — no prometheus.yml. Frame 3: what happened without you —
the operator saw the ServiceMonitor, resolved the Service's endpoints, WROTE the scrape config, and
Prometheus started scraping; the target shows UP on /targets. Now you can query the scraped metric:
rate(http_requests_total[5m]) = the per-second request rate averaged over a 5-minute window, one
result series per label combination (status code, method). That's the loop: CR in → target UP →
data out. The lab does exactly this, but breaks frame 2's selector first so you diagnose it on
/targets. Next: read that PromQL properly.

Speaker: demystify the one query the lab runs. http_requests_total is a COUNTER — a
monotonically-increasing total (requests since the process started). Its raw value is nearly
useless: "12,904 total" tells you nothing about now. rate(counter[5m]) is the workhorse: it computes
the per-SECOND average increase over the trailing 5-minute window, and crucially it's
reset-aware — when a Pod restarts and the counter drops to 0, rate() doesn't report a huge negative
spike. {code="200"} is a label matcher — PromQL is a label-selection language, the same
label-thinking as Services and NetworkPolicy, applied to time-series. Land the golden-signals tie:
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) = total traffic (signal 2); the same with code=~"5.." over total
= the error rate (signal 3). One function turns a boring counter into the two most important signals.
This is the query the learner runs against their own app in the lab. Next: recap, then go do it.

Speaker: tie the bow and point forward. The problem: you cannot hand-maintain scrape config against
ephemeral Pods, so monitoring had to become declarative and label-driven like the rest of
Kubernetes. The answer: the Prometheus Operator — S22's CRD+controller pattern shipped for real —
watches ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor CRs and GENERATES the scrape config. Facts to leave them with: the
four CRDs (Prometheus = the server, ServiceMonitor = targets via a Service, PodMonitor = via Pods,
Alertmanager = alert routing); the four golden signals (latency/traffic/errors/saturation) and the
metrics/logs/traces split (Prometheus = metrics); the two standard sources (kube-state-metrics for
object state, node-exporter for host state); and the ServiceMonitor mechanics — select the Service
by label, name the metrics port (a NAME), and rate() to read a counter as a rate. Hand to Lab 23:
install kube-prometheus-stack, expose an app on /metrics, wire a ServiceMonitor, break it with a
mismatched selector and diagnose on the /targets page, fix it, then run rate(http_requests_total).
Forward to S24: you've now USED two operators — next, a peek at building one.

## Lab 23 — Scrape your app

- Install **`kube-prometheus-stack`** (Helm); confirm the operator + CRDs (`kubectl get crd | grep monitoring.coreos.com`)
- Deploy an app exposing **`/metrics`** on a **named** port; apply a **`ServiceMonitor`** selecting its Service by label
- **Break:** a **mismatched selector** → no target appears; diagnose on the Prometheus **`/targets`** page (`port-forward`)
- **Fix:** match the selector to the Service's labels → the target goes **UP**
- Generate load, then run **`rate(http_requests_total[5m])`** and read the result
