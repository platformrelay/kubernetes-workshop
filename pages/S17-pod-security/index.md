# Pod security

Harden a Pod; understand Pod Security Standards.

**core** · suggested Day 3 · Security track

<!--
Section S17 — Pod security (securityContext + Pod Security Standards / Admission).
Opens Day 3 (M5). Timing: ~30 min slides + 25 min lab. Outcome: learners can harden a Pod
to the `restricted` standard by setting the FOUR fields it gates, explain why PSA rejects a
Pod at admission (before it exists), and distinguish admission enforcement (PSA) from the
runtime enforcement the kubelet applies (runAsNonRoot on an image that runs as root → CrashLoop).
Beats: problem (root + writable rootfs on a shared kernel → foreshadows S25) · mental model
(container vs pod-level securityContext; PSS ladder privileged/baseline/restricted) ·
code-annotated (the four restricted gates) · magic-move (insecure → four gates PASS restricted →
+readOnlyRootFilesystem, BEYOND restricted) · S02 callback + the runtime landmine · PSA via
namespace labels (enforce/warn/audit) · AdmissionGate animation · recap → S25 · lab.
Animation: AdmissionGate.vue (new, self-contained) — request → PSA check → deny then admit.
ACCURACY LOCKS (verified against the current Pod Security Standards doc):
- `restricted` gates EXACTLY four spec fields for a plain Pod: runAsNonRoot:true,
  allowPrivilegeEscalation:false, capabilities.drop:["ALL"], seccompProfile RuntimeDefault|Localhost.
- readOnlyRootFilesystem is NOT a restricted requirement — it's beyond-restricted hardening,
  authored as the FINAL magic-move step and the lab's post-admission break→fix.
- runAsNonRoot passes PSA admission when the field is set, but the KUBELET enforces at runtime:
  a stock root image admits then CrashLoops ("container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as
  root"). We use nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged so the harden lab actually runs.
CKx tie-in: CKAD securityContext + CKA admission/security hardening.

layout: statement
kicker: The problem
---

Your container shares the host's **kernel** — and by default it runs as **root** on it.

Every earlier `web` Pod ran as **UID 0** with a **writable root filesystem** and the full set
of Linux capabilities. On a shared node that's one kernel bug — or one compromised
dependency — away from a container that can write where it shouldn't, add capabilities, or
climb toward the host. Least privilege isn't paperwork here; it's the blast radius.

<!--
Speaker: the "why care" beat, and it foreshadows S25 (pod escape). A container is not a VM —
it's a process on the HOST kernel, isolated by namespaces + cgroups (callback to S01/S03). If
the process is root and the isolation has a hole, root-in-container is a long way toward
root-on-node. Two concrete defaults to name: (1) most images run as UID 0 unless told otherwise;
(2) the root filesystem is writable, so a foothold can drop tools/binaries. This section gives
you the two levers that shrink the blast radius: the Pod's own `securityContext` (what the Pod
asks to be) and Pod Security Admission (what the platform will let in). S25 turns these same
knobs into named defences against a real escape.

<!--
Speaker: separate the two ideas cleanly, because learners fuse them. securityContext is what
YOUR manifest declares — Pod-level (spec.securityContext) sets defaults for all containers,
container-level (spec.containers[].securityContext) overrides for one; container wins on
overlap. Pod Security STANDARDS are the CNCF-defined profiles — privileged (no-op), baseline
(blocks the obviously dangerous — hostNetwork, privileged, hostPath…), restricted (baseline +
least privilege). It's a ladder: each rung is a superset of the one below. The platform picks a
rung per namespace and the built-in admission controller checks your Pod against it. Next slide:
exactly which fields `restricted` checks — it's a short, learnable list.

<!--
Speaker: this is the memorise-this slide. For a PLAIN Pod (no host namespaces, no volumes to
worry about), `restricted` gates exactly these four fields — nothing else. runAsNonRoot=true,
allowPrivilegeEscalation=false, capabilities.drop must contain ALL (you may add back only
NET_BIND_SERVICE), and seccompProfile.type is RuntimeDefault or Localhost. Set at the container
level here; three of them (runAsNonRoot, seccompProfile) can also sit at Pod level to cover all
containers at once. If a learner asks "what about readOnlyRootFilesystem?" — hold it, it's the
next-but-two slide, and it is NOT one of these four. The lab clears these violations one at a
time; the exact violation strings come straight from the admission controller.

<!--
Speaker: SIX frames, and the caption boundary matters. Frames 0→4 each clear ONE restricted
violation, in the same order the admission controller lists them; by frame 4 all four gates
pass and the Pod is admitted. STOP and say it: frame 4 is `restricted`-compliant. Frame 5 adds
readOnlyRootFilesystem — call out explicitly that this is NOT part of restricted, it's extra
hardening (and it's what the lab breaks: a read-only root filesystem stops nginx writing its
cache/pid, so you add emptyDir mounts for those paths). Image note: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged
already runs as UID 101 and listens on 8080, so runAsNonRoot is a promise it keeps — which is
exactly the runtime point on the next slide. The lab applies these frames as real files and
watches the gate flip from Forbidden to created.

<span class="kw-kicker">so the image has to actually be non-root</span>

Either the image sets a non-root `USER` (this is exactly the **non-root image you built in
container security**), or you pin `runAsUser` to a real non-root UID the image can run as. We use
`nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged` — it ships as UID **101** and listens on **8080**, so the promise
holds and the Pod runs.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Speaker: this is the landmine that bites everyone, and it's the honest S02 tie-in. runAsNonRoot:
true is not "make me non-root" — it's an ASSERTION the platform verifies two different ways.
Admission (PSA) only checks the field is present, so it admits. The kubelet, at container
create, resolves the image's effective UID; if that's 0 and runAsNonRoot is true, it errors with
"container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root" — the Pod exists but never starts
(CreateContainerError → CrashLoopBackOff). The fix is not a securityContext field — it's the
IMAGE: build it non-root (S02's multi-stage, non-root USER) or set runAsUser to a UID the image
actually supports. Standard nginx runs as root and would hit this; nginx-unprivileged runs as
101, so our hardened Pod actually serves traffic. Point back to S02: the reason we did all that
image hygiene is so runtime hardening like this is even possible.

<!--
Speaker: Pod Security ADMISSION is how a Standard gets applied — and it's namespace-scoped
LABELS, nothing to install (built into the API server since 1.25, stable). Three independent
modes, each can name a different profile and version: enforce (reject — the only one that
blocks), warn (create anyway, but return a Warning to kubectl — the author sees it), audit
(create anyway, write it to the audit log — the platform sees it). The migration play, worth
saying: label warn+audit=restricted first, watch what would break via warnings/audit, fix the
workloads, THEN switch enforce=restricted. Version pin (enforce-version: v1.34) freezes the
ruleset so a cluster upgrade doesn't silently tighten it. The lab sets enforce (kind) or uses a
pre-labelled namespace (shared cluster). Next: watch the gate rule, live.

Speaker: drive with clicks; this makes the admission moment physical, and it's exactly the lab.
(0) the insecure Pod heading for the gate. (1) the gate rules — four red ✗, verdict DENIED
(Forbidden); crucial point: the Pod is NEVER created, there's nothing to kubectl get, nothing to
delete — contrast with the runtime failures from S13/S14 where the Pod exists and misbehaves.
This is admission enforcement: the API server said no before etcd ever saw it. (2) re-apply the
hardened version. (3) four green ✓, ADMITTED, Pod lands in the namespace Running. The takeaway:
you didn't change the policy or beg an admin — you changed your manifest to meet the bar. That's
the whole loop the learner runs in Lab 17.

layout: recap
heading: 'Recap — least privilege, and who enforces it when'
story: 'The insecure Pod was refused before it existed (admission); the same Pod, hardened, walked straight in. readOnlyRootFilesystem then broke the app at runtime — a different layer, a different fix.'
next: 'NetworkPolicy — the network complement: default-deny pod-to-pod traffic and explicit allows'
---

- **`securityContext`** = what the Pod asks to be; **Pod Security Standards** = privileged →
  baseline → **restricted**, the platform's bar
- `restricted` gates **four** fields: `runAsNonRoot` · `allowPrivilegeEscalation:false` ·
  `drop ["ALL"]` · `seccompProfile` — set them and you're in
- **`readOnlyRootFilesystem` is *beyond* restricted** — great hygiene, but it can break apps
  that write to `/` (fix with an `emptyDir`)
- **PSA = namespace labels** (`enforce`/`warn`/`audit`), built in — `warn` first, then `enforce`
- Two layers: **admission** rejects before the Pod exists (PSA); the **kubelet** enforces at
  runtime (`runAsNonRoot` on a root image → CrashLoop) — sets up **pod-escape** defences

<!--
Speaker: land the two-layer mental model, because it's the thread through the rest of Day 3.
ADMISSION (PSA) decides whether the Pod may exist at all — pure YAML check, namespace-scoped,
happens before storage. RUNTIME (kubelet + kernel: seccomp, caps, the runAsNonRoot reality
check, readOnlyRootFilesystem) governs what the Pod may DO once it's running. `restricted` is
four fields; readOnlyRootFilesystem is a fifth good habit that's NOT part of it and needs an
emptyDir when the app writes to disk. Migrate namespaces with warn→enforce so you never surprise
a team. All of this is the toolkit S25 uses against a real pod escape, and it pairs with S18
(NetworkPolicy) for the network side. Hand to Lab 17: label a namespace restricted, get your
insecure Pod refused, harden it field by field until the gate admits it, then meet
readOnlyRootFilesystem and give it a writable path.

- **Break:** apply a bare, root, no-context Pod → **Forbidden**; read the four-violation list
- **Fix:** add the four fields one at a time, re-applying until the gate **admits** it
- Turn on `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, watch the app fail to write, and give it an `emptyDir`
- Confirm with `kubectl exec … id` (non-root UID) and that writes to `/` are refused
