# Container security & supply chain

Build images that are small, non-root, and scanned — the build-time half of security.

**recommended** · suggested Day 1 · Foundations track

<!--
Section S02 — Container security & supply chain. Timing: ~30 min slides + 25 min lab.
Outcome: learners can build and choose images that are small, non-root, and scanned —
the build-time half of Kubernetes security (S17/S25 cover the runtime half).
Beats: the risky image (fat + root + baked secret) · four build-time moves ·
harden it one fix per step (magic-move) · a deleted layer still ships · scanning
(illustrative, tools as examples) · SBOM · sign + pin by digest · foreshadow S17/S25/S26.
CKx tie-in: CKAD/CKA security foundations (image hygiene precedes runtime hardening).
Lab: labs/day-1/02-container-security.md.

FROM golang:1.24                 # (1) fat base — a whole toolchain in the ship
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .                         # (2) COPYs everything, secrets included
COPY deploy_key /src/deploy_key  # (3) a build secret, baked into a layer
RUN go build -o /bin/app .
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/app"]          # (4) no USER → runs as root
```

::notes::

<CodeNote at="1" label="fat base" variant="warn">
The full Go toolchain — compiler, shell, package manager — <strong>ships to
production</strong>. Every one of those is code an attacker can use and a CVE you
now own.
</CodeNote>

<CodeNote at="2" label="COPY . ." variant="warn">
Copies the <strong>whole build context</strong> into a layer — <code>.git</code>,
local <code>.env</code> files, test fixtures. What you didn't mean to ship is now
shipped.
</CodeNote>

<CodeNote at="3" label="baked secret" variant="danger">
A private key written into a layer. Even if a later step deletes it, the layer
that added it <strong>still exists</strong> in the image history — recoverable by
anyone who pulls it.
</CodeNote>

<CodeNote at="4" label="root" variant="danger">
No <code>USER</code>, so PID 1 is <strong>root</strong>. A process escape from
this container starts as root on the node — exactly what Day 3's pod-escape module
attacks.
</CodeNote>

<!--
Speaker: four independent mistakes in six lines, and every one is common. This
slide is the "before"; the magic-move two slides on is the "after". The secret
and the root user are the two that graduate into runtime attacks (S17/S25).

<!--
Speaker: one fix per step, mirroring the four moves. CGO_ENABLED=0 makes the Go
binary static so it runs on alpine/distroless (no libc). FIX 2 needs the
`# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` directive for `--mount=type=secret` (BuildKit).
FIX 3's distroless/static:nonroot ships no shell — you can't `exec sh` into it,
which is the point. The digest in FIX 4 is illustrative — the lab has them fetch
the real one. This "after" image is what the lab scans against the "before".

::notes::

<CodeNote at="1" label="the layer that adds it" variant="danger">
Adding the file creates a layer whose content <strong>is</strong> the secret. That

A later layer records a <em>whiteout</em> that hides the file from the final

You can't delete your way out — you must never <strong>add</strong> the secret to

<!--
Speaker: this is the single most expensive beginner mistake in this section. The
mental hook: layers are append-only; `rm` is a new layer, not an edit. Rotate any
secret that ever touched a shipped layer — assume it's public.

Speaker: SBOM answers "am I affected?" fast; signing answers "is this really our
image?"; provenance answers "how was it built?". Mental-model depth only — the lab
does SBOM for real and demos sign/verify as expected output. Enforcement (only
admit signed images) is S17/S25.

- **Minimal / distroless base** → fewer packages, fewer CVEs, nothing to pivot through
- **Non-root `USER`** → an escape lands unprivileged, not as root on the node
- **Multi-stage + secret mounts** → toolchains and secrets never reach a shipped layer
- **A deleted layer still ships** → never *add* a secret; rotate anything that did
- **Scan, SBOM, sign, pin by digest** → know what's inside and prove where it came from

This is the **build-time** half. Kubernetes enforces the **runtime** half later —
Pod Security Standards + NetworkPolicy (**S17**), the pod-escape walkthrough
(**S25**), and the production-readiness checklist (**S26**). CKx: security
foundations — image hygiene precedes runtime hardening.

## Lab 02 — Scan & harden an image

- **Scan** a deliberately vulnerable image and record the HIGH/CRITICAL count
- **Harden it:** minimal base + non-root `USER` + multi-stage → **re-scan** and compare
- **SBOM:** generate one for the hardened image and find a dependency in it
- **Break it on purpose:** bake a secret, recover it from image history, then remove it *correctly*
- **Sign & pin:** (optional) sign/verify, then pin the final reference by **digest**
